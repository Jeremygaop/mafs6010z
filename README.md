### Step1 Feature Engineering

- EDA_application_train_&_application_test.ipynb and preprocess_POS_CASH_balance_&_credit_card_balance.ipynb are used to conduct EDA and feature engineering for application_train.csv, application_test.csv, POS_CASH_balance.csv and credit_card_balance.csv.

- feature_engineering.py is used to conduct feature engineering for bureau.csv, bureau_balance.csv, previous_application.csv and installments_payments.csv.


### Step2 feature selection

- feature_selection.py is used to conduct feature selection for all the datasets and prepare the final datasets for model training.


### Step3 model training
